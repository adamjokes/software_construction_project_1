# Workampus Mobile Application 

## This project is developed for my Final Year Project at UTM as a software engineering student.

The proposed system is called Workampus Mobile Application which is a cross-platform system that are both deployable on Android and iOS devices. The system is built for two type user which are job seeker and job provider, however, studies also found that users prefer to have a single account on the system with the ability to switch roles between job seeker and job provider which have been implemented into this system. Job seeker can use this app to look for available jobs and if it is not yet existed, the job seeker can offer their service on this platform. For job provider, they can use this system to see find available service and at the same time create a job post so that it is visible for the job seeker. The chosen methodology is iterative model in software development lifecycle this is because it has the advantage of being more flexible which allows changes to be done by evaluating every iteration. The selected architecture design used to support the system development process is Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. Furthermore, User Acceptance Testing (UAT) have been conducted to test the acceptance of user towards the functionality of the system. Lastly, the objectives of this paper have successfully achieved with all the requirements of this system being gathered and documented successfully. In conclusion, the project is developed accordingly.
